If you have read the original book you will be able to test your knowledge easily by just chatting with bot in Telegram.

If you want to, you can explore the source code of TrachtenbergBot in Telegram, it is written on its own micro-framework for work with Telegram API and library for working with math operations.

Bot restarts at 20:00 MSK in case some users stopped using the bot and new bot are available for usage.
