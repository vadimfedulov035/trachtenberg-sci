If you have read the original book you will be able to test your knowledge easily by just startings programs, scripts or
writing to your own private Trachtenberg(num)Bot in Telegram.

To test on your computer:

'python3 berg.py' for test in any OS where Python is installed

'./berg.exe' for test in any distribution excluding Windows

'./berg.sh' for test in any GNU/Linux distribution where /usr/bin/sh is linked to Dash

If you want to, you can explore the source code of TrachtenbergBot in Telegram, it is written on its own micro-framework from
scratch. It accesses Telegram API without any intermediate libraries, except native Python and NumPy. Because of complex function
and operations it is able to continue only one conversation. So your mistakes will be private, hehe. Just put your token of
created Trachtenberg(num)Bot into tok.conf and than start it by:

'python3 bot.py' to start bot with Python

'./bot.exe' to start bot with power of cows and Cython + GCC compiled binary
